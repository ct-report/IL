Contact Tracing - Israel

**HAMAGEN** - developed in a joint effort by developers from the Ministry of Health, commercial companies, and volunteers from various organizations and the developer community in Israel.

It relies only on GPS/Location by locally matching with areas/paths of infected users provided by the Ministry of Health. 

User's locations & paths are stored locally in the device. Only those of confirmed infected users are uploaded to the server. App allows also to import location history related to Google account.
